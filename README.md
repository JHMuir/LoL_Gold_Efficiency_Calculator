# LoL_Gold_Efficiency_Calculator
A short python script to find how gold efficient an item is League of Legends.

It's probably slow and user-unfriendly but it's just something quick I whipped up in a morning :). 

To change the item, you would need to change input.txt. Write out the item's numerical stats, followed by the type of stat- the exact names of the type of stats can be found in the code, under reference_stats. When you enter these stats, separate each stat using a comma, and do not use spaces. The line with the '#' is the item's full cost. The line with the '$' is the item name. 

Currently it only handles one item at a time. I will be updating in in the future to handle multiple items at a time.
